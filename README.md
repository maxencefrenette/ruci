# Async UCI, asynchronous UCI for Rust

This is a UCI protocol implementation (GUI side) using [nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom) for parsing and [tokio-process](https://github.com/alexcrichton/tokio-process) for asynchronous I/O with child processes. If you want a UCI implementation to build a chess engine, check out [alcibiades](https://github.com/epandurski/alcibiades) instead.

This library is still under heavy development, there is still a lot to be done. Don't hesitate to open an issue if there is any improvement you'd like to be made to the library.
